Overview
In Week 4, we delve into advanced Java features, including:

    Generics: Writing type-safe, reusable code.
    
    Collections Framework: Lists, Sets, Maps, and their implementations.
    
    I/O Streams: Reading/writing data efficiently.
    
    Exception Handling: Robust error management.
    
    Regex & Unit Testing: Pattern matching and testing fundamentals.
    
    Java 8 Features: Lambdas, Streams, and functional programming paradigms.
============================================================================

Topics Covered
----------------------------------------------------------------
01_JavaGenerics

    Introduction to Generics and type parameters.
    Generic classes, methods, and interfaces.
    Bounded type parameters and wildcards (?, T, K, V).
    Type erasure and limitations.

02_Collections

    Core Interfaces: List, Set, Queue, Map.
    Implementations:
    ArrayList vs LinkedList.
    HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet.
    HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap.
    Utilities: Collections class (sorting, shuffling).

03_JavaIOStreams

    Byte Streams (InputStream, OutputStream).
    Character Streams (Reader, Writer).
    Buffered Streams and serialization.
    Files and Paths utilities (NIO).

04_Exceptions

    Checked vs Unchecked exceptions.
    try-catch-finally blocks.
    Custom exceptions and best practices.

05_Regex&Unit

    Regex: Pattern matching with java.util.regex.
    Unit Testing: Basics of JUnit (@Test, assertions).

06_Java8Features

    Lambda Expressions: Functional programming syntax.
    Stream API: filter, map, reduce, collect.
    Optional class and DateTime API.

Prerequisites

    Java installed and set up with JDK (version 8 or later recommended).
    Familiarity with Java basics (classes, interfaces, methods).
    A Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or a text editor with terminal access. 
How to Use This Repository

    Each folder corresponds to a specific topic (e.g., 01_JavaGenerics).
    Navigate to the relevant folder to find code implementations and exercises.
